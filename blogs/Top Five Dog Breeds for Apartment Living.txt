Dog Breeds
Not all dog breeds are suited for small spaces, but some thrive in apartments. Here are five breeds ideal for apartment living:

French Bulldog – Small, quiet, and affectionate, they require minimal exercise.

Cavalier King Charles Spaniel – Friendly and adaptable, they enjoy cuddles and short walks.

Pug – Playful but not overly energetic, they make great indoor pets.

Shih Tzu – Low-energy and affectionate, they are perfect for smaller homes.

Greyhound – Surprisingly calm indoors despite their speed, they are great couch companions.

While these breeds adapt well to apartments, proper care, exercise, and mental stimulation are still essential for their well-being.
