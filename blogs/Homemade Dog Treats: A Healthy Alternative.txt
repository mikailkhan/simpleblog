 Dog Nutrition
Many store-bought dog treats contain preservatives and artificial ingredients. Making homemade treats is a healthier alternative and allows owners to control what their dogs consume.

A simple recipe involves mixing peanut butter (xylitol-free), mashed bananas, and oats to form a dough. This mixture can be shaped into small treats and baked for a crunchy texture. Another easy option is freezing yogurt with blueberries for a refreshing summer snack.

Homemade treats should be given in moderation and tailored to a dog's dietary needs. Consulting a veterinarian before introducing new foods is always advisable to ensure the treats are safe and beneficial.
