Dog Behavior
Dogs communicate primarily through body language, and understanding their signals can strengthen the bond between pet and owner. A wagging tail, for example, doesn’t always mean happiness—it depends on the speed and position of the tail. A slow wag with a low tail may indicate insecurity, while a fast, high wag suggests excitement.

Ears also play a role in communication. Perked-up ears indicate alertness, while flattened ears suggest fear or submission. Similarly, a relaxed body means a comfortable dog, whereas a stiff posture could signal aggression or anxiety.

Yawning and lip-licking are often signs of stress, not tiredness. Observing these subtle cues can help owners respond appropriately to their dog’s needs and emotions, ensuring a trusting and loving relationship.
